                <p>
                    <h3>Is there a sight more iconic, more beautiful, more jaw-droppingly spectacular than the Taj Mahal?</h3><br><br>
                    
            
                    Quite honestly, we can’t think of one.<br> <br>
                    
                    At the very least, there’s no mausoleum more grand, no declaration of love more apparent than building a marble masterpiece <br>for one’s favorite wife… And no better reason to travel than seeing its magnificence up close.<br> <br>
                    
                    After all, this is art. Built in Agra <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india">india</a></span> between 1631 and 1648, it’s also history. And, of course, it’s the perfect opportunity<br> to take some otherworldly photos. So, to help visitors prepare for their Taj Mahal travels, we’ve prepared a little guide,<br> enlisting the help of some Intrepid experts – from Destination Managers to acclaimed trip leaders – to cover all the bases.<br><br>
                    
                    Coming up: what to bring, where to take the best snaps, what else to see in Agra (and beyond), and so much more…<br><br>
                    
                    <h4>Before you arrive at the Taj Mahal</h4>
                    That old saying ‘patience is a virtue’ really comes into its own when discussing the Taj Mahal.<br><br>
                    
                    Be prepared to be surrounded by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. These include Indian men, women and children<br> who may ask to take photos with you.<br><br>
                    
                    To prepare with the help of other travelers and a local tour guide, consider taking a group tour. Intrepid have Taj-visiting<br> trips that range from<span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/golden-triangle-101271"> 8-day Golden Triangle tours</a></span> (now with <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/golden-triangle-solo-travellers-109795">solo-only departures</a></span> !) to<span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/real-food-adventure-india-102068"> 15-day trips dedicated to food,</a></span><br>  to 19-day trips combining the  <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/highlights-india-and-nepal-102239">highlights of India and Nepal</a></span> .<br><br>

            <p>
                The entrance queue can be pretty long during peak season but as long as you’re mentally prepared, you’ll be fine. What’s to <br>come is more than worth the wait…
            
            <h4>What to bring to the Taj Mahal</h4>
            Always leave your valuables in the hotel. There are lockers available at the Taj but it’s best to have minimal belongings on<br> you so you don’t spend too much time checking in.<br><br>
            
            You really only need to bring the following in one small bag:<br>
            <ul>
                <li class="l1">Passport</li>
                  <li class="l2">Money</li>
                <li class="l3">Water</li>
                <li class="l4">Medicine</li>
                <li class="15">Camera</li>
                <li class="61"> Phone</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>What to wear to the Taj Mahal</h4>
            There is no dress code but you should still be respectful. If you want to enter the mosque, you will need to cover your head, <br>shoulders and knees.<br><br>
            
            It gets hot in Agra and there is very little shade, so wear light clothing and make sure you wear sunscreen. Then again, Agra <br>also gets very cold in winter (Nov-Feb) so layers are your friend too.<br><br>
            
            If you visit with Intrepid, you’ll be taken there earlier in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid the worst of the heat.

            <p>Useful tip from Ryan Turner, Intrepid’s Destination Manager for India:</p>
            <table>
              <th>
            <td><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i></td><th><p id="have">Having been to the Taj a few times, I’ve learnt the importance of wearing shoes that are<br> easy to remove. You need to take your shoes off when you go inside and the easier they are<br> to slip on and off the better. This actually applies to much of India – shoes with loads of laces are hard!</p>
            </th>
            </table>
            <p>
                <h4>Other things you need to know</h4>
            No food is allowed inside.<br><br>
            
            Cigarettes and lighters are also not allowed.<br><br>
            
            Tripods and additional lighting equipment need prior permission to be brought with. <br>Photography inside the mausoleum is prohibited. Most electronics (except cameras and small<br> video cameras) are not allowed.
            
            Be wary of touts, thieves and rude shop keepers. It’s a busy, high-pressure area, but keep your<br> wits about you and you won’t need to worry!
            
            <h4>When you’re at the Taj Mahal</h4>
            Go early, wait for space to explore and photograph, and get yourself away from the crowds (if<br> possible).

            <p>
              you walk around to the right side of the Taj (as you approach the east gate), you can get an amazing photo from the riverbank <br>behind the Taj. (Always go in groups and get a rickshaw to take you there and back cheaply.)

              And simply focus on taking in all<br> the magic. Even Intrepid leaders who see the Taj Mahal monthly (or more!) remain in awe of it.<span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/sana-female-intrepid-leader-india/">Sana Jinah</a></span> , one of the company’s<br> inspiring female tour guides, has some tips on how to do this:<br></p>

             <h4> Tips for taking photos at the Taj Mahal</h4>
              Everyone wants that iconic shot of themselves at the Taj Mahal. You know the one – where you sit on the bench and the grandeur<br> of the marble mausoleum forms the backdrop.

       <p>But if you’re feeling creative and want to mix things up, there are tons of different angles worth seeking out.

      Below are some<br> photography suggestions from Intrepid’s General Manager in India, <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/pravin-intrepid-manager-gender-equality-india/">PravinTamang</a></span>.

        <li class="61"> The Taj Mahal can also be shot from some parts of the Red Fort
        </li><br>
    </ul>
   <p>
    You can also get great photos from the many rooftops of restaurants close to the Taj Mahal. Unfortunately, Agra does <br>get pretty smoggy, so winter can often have poor visibility earlier in the day and around sunset. That said, this can make shots<br> look very atmospheric!

    <p><h4>What to do after visiting the Taj Mahal</h4>
      First, go back to your hotel room, take a shower, and revel in the relative peace and quiet. Then explore these cool destinations <br>both in and out of Agra:
      
      <h4>What to do in Agra</h4>
      The Taj Mahal is, quite clearly, the star of the show in this northern Indian city. <br>But the Agra Fort is also stunning, especially if you didn’t get a chance to go to the Red Fort in Delhi. A 16th-century Mughal<br> monument and UNESCO World Heritage site, <br>it’s a sight not to be missed.
      
      Despite being located on the  <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/golden-triangle-101271">Golden Triangle </a></span>tourist circuit, there’s less to do in Agra than in many<br> other Indian cities. It’s pretty polluted from the heavy industry (more on that later) and you likely won’t spend too long there, whatever <br>the trip.
      
      One way that Intrepid tries to show visitors a different perspective on the country is by (sometimes) taking travelers<br> to <span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2016/12/23/sheroes-hangout-cafe_n_13830342.html">Sheroes Hangout.</a></span> Just blocks from the Taj Mahal, it’s a small cafe run entirely by female acid attack survivors. Here, victims<br> of attacks are employed and tell their stories. It can be confronting, but also inspiring and memorable in equal measures.
      <br><br>

      <br><br>
      <h4>Where to go outside of Agra</h4>
      There are various great destinations only a few hours drive (well, 4-7) from the Taj Mahal. Of these, Orchha, Jaipur and Pushkar are all <br>tourist-friendly, peaceful and beautiful places.
      
      Orchha is a town that travelers often overlook. This is a shame, because it’s historic,<br> laid-back and has a bunch of beautiful temples. It’s <br>not always on tour itineraries, but you CAN visit it on <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/delhi-kathmandu-101281">this 15-day trip</a></span> from <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/nepal/delhi-to-kathmandu">Delhi to Kathmandu</a></span> (cooking demo and palace visit included!).

  <h4 id ="ch">Chaturbhuj Temple in Orchha</h4>
        <p>Jaipur is much more well-known. Also known as the<span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/top-colourful-cities/">‘Pink City’</a></span>  , the capital of Rajasthan is full of chaos, charm and unique<br> architecture. Visit the hilltop Amber Fort, haggle in the enchanting bazaars, and consider taking a hot air balloon over the city <br>to take it all in.

          Pushkar is another underrated town. One of the oldest and most serene towns in India, it’s home to Pushkar Lake,<br> a sacred spot for Hindus that’s utterly dazzling at sundown. Because of its holy nature, the vegetarian food here is simply unmissable. <br>Visit on<span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/india/classic-rajasthan-101273">this 15-day trip</a></span>  all around Rajasthan.
          
          <h4>A final note about the Taj Mahal’s mud therapy</h4>
          As you may have <span><a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/adventures/taj-mahal-mud-restoration/">read</a></span>   or heard, the Taj Mahal has recently been undergoing a very thorough clean. Yep, to be precise, a mud mask <br>as of April 2018.
          
          Why? Air pollution from factories in Agra had been slowly turning the Taj Mahal’s ivory-white surfaces yellow <br>    – and this was one way of restoring them to their former glory. The work – applying a clay traditionally used to clean marble<br> to the entire structure of the Taj – was carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India. And this work was part of a series<br> of restorative projects carried out on the historic site.
